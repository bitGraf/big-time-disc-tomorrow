TODO:

AI:
- Fix math for distanceToPatrol
- Issue w/ targetPos on same axis as Pos
- Sometimes rotate wrong/awkward direction

Geometry:
- Fix panel transition math
- Add 'smooth' transitioning
- Player/AI location is misaligned with model, leads to awkward interactions

Gamestate:
- Add inventory/player-stattracker
- Add loading/saving
